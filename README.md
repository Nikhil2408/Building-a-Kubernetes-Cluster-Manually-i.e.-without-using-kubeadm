This repository represents the manual installation of Kubernetes i.e without using kubeadm. I have also done the installation using kubeadm. 

If you want to do installation using kubeadm, refer to <a href="https://github.com/Nikhil2408/Building-a-Kubernetes-Cluster"> Building a Kubernetes Cluster </a> repository.

<h3> Kubernetes </h3>

Kubernetes (K8s) is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It automates the application infrastructure and make it easy to manage it. Kubernetes is all about managing containers. 

<h2> Architecture Implemented </h2>

<h2> Requirements </h2>

From the architecture it is clear that 5 ubuntu servers are required. 2 Controller nodes, 2 Worker nodes and 1 Kubernetes API Load balancer server. I have used <a href="https://linuxacademy.com/"> LinuxAcademy </a> cloud servers and Ubuntu 18 as my operating system on each of the server.

Besides these five ubuntu servers, you will be requiring one more machine i.e. the local workstation from which you will be interacting with the Kubernetes Cluster.

<h2> Let's Start Building the Cluster manually </h2>

<h3> 1. Installing the Client tools on the local machine </h3>

In order to proceed further, first of all install two client tools on the local workstation. These two client tools include <b> cfssl </b> and <b> kubectl </b>.

 <b> For cfssl: </b>
 
 ```javascript
 wget -q --show-progress --https-only --timestamping \
 https://pkg.cfssl.org/R1.2/cfssl_linux-amd64 \
 https://pkg.cfssl.org/R1.2/cfssljson_linux-amd64
 ```

```javascript
chmod +x cfssl_linux-amd64 cfssljson_linux-amd64
```

```javascript
sudo mv cfssl_linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/cfssl
```

```javascript
sudo mv cfssljson_linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/cfssljson
```
