This repository represents the manual installation of Kubernetes i.e without using kubeadm. I have also done the installation using kubeadm. 

If you want to do installation using kubeadm, refer to <a href="https://github.com/Nikhil2408/Building-a-Kubernetes-Cluster"> Building a Kubernetes Cluster </a> repository.
